# Reflection
I have learned a lot this semseter thanks to professor Weiss. I came into this open source class thinking that I would not do much
contributing since I had very little knowledge on open source in general but now, I have learned the tools to contribute to 
open source projects. When I first came into this class I thought that I was just going to edit a few wiki pages and learn some git commands
but I learned much more. There have been some guest speakers that came and talked about what they did for a living and how companies use or view 
open source. This was extremly helpful because I got an understanding on how companies work and how open source is sitll revelant to peoples lives
other than building a portfolio for job interviews. 

What surprised me the most in this course was learning about the license. Before this course, I thought open source more of a hobby for
computer scientist or a place to fiddle around with code and learn but I was very wrong. When I learned about the copy left law, I started liking open source
more and more. The more I learned about copy left, the more I thought that the open source community is filled with people who want to help and teach other rather than
make a profit for themselves.

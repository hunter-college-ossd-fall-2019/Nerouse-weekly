Why you decided to take a course in open source software?

As a student persuing a computer science degree, you often hear the term "open source" thrown around. When I first hear of
open source, I had no idea what open source was. I knew that it was a group of people working together on a project for free
and that it could be good for finding a job in the future. But as I learned more about computer science and the world of it,
I learned how interesting the open source community was. I thought it was amazing that I was able to contribute to other
programs and take programs and modify them to run how I want them to. After learning this, I became more invested in open
source. So I decided to take a course in open source softwawre.
